Crappy hotel room

W/ Lydia

Maybe another person in a second back bedroom?

Three spider "egg sacs" in the top right corner above the bed. White, weird elongated. Looked like they collected dust and balls of hair. Security camera above the spiderwebs. Flat, black, words on top. Not hidden.

Tried lying in bed, me on the left Lydia on the right. The bed squeaks and makes noises like it's going to fall apart. I say something about well I wish we could have slept on these sides so it's different than at home.

Fooling around in bed, with some weird fantasy play where I was acting dead. Basically just strange kissing and exploring my mouth. Felt slightly embarrassed after I noticed there was a security camera above the bed.

Lydia noticed bugs in the bed, I thought she was wrong. I reached down and it was a crumbled Oreo. I was disappointed in her putting food in bed but didn't say anything.

She got up to do something in the bathroom, I stood up on the bed because I noticed two mosquitos.

I got the first one after some struggle. Kept going for the second one. Always up above head.

It moved down to the foot of the bed, I smacked at it and noticed there was a moth.

Was able to hit the moth with a good slap, and it fell onto the bed and then to the floor. Seemed to have a little dust cloud when it hit.

Realized it wasn't a dust cloud, it was smoke. Smoke was coming from the wall socket where the AC unit was plugged in.

Removed AC cord plugged in the bottom socket. There was no wall plate. Tried blowing on the wall socket. Lydia still in the other room, didn't tell her about the smoke because I didn't want to make her nervous.

Was positive there wasn't anybody "on duty" to help because it was a crappy hotel. Started to freak out.

Woke up.
