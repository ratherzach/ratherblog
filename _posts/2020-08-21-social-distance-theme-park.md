Transition between watching videos or blogs from a CEO of SeaWorld, to actually **being** the CEO, to just being myself at SeaWorld.

The CEO was walking around the park, talking about all of the safety measures they are taking for COVID. But there were still some visitors not wearing masks or wearing them wrong. The CEO, when turning the camera around to show his face, was also wearing his mask wrong. It was hanging from his chin.

A group of young guys were flying drones around a central area of the park. It felt like they were using their drone to get footage of a group of three attractive girls, but would turn their drone to look at the fountain in the park or other landmarks to hide their intentions.

Fireworks went off... Even though it was daytime and also overcast. The drone guys got excited and flew their drone off in the direction of the fireworks. At this point, I am no longer the CEO, but actually Zach and potentially Lydia is now there.

We follow the drone guys and other visitors toward the fireworks, and find a few benches to sit down because it starts to rain lightly. I'm caring a couple rain jackets, a clear umbrella, and backpack or lunch box.

Stephen and David are also now there, but they are going ahead of me and Lydia into a bar.

----Lydia goes ahead. Find everyone. Lots of people at table. "I guess we aren't social distancing" Lydia says. Rhubarb food order.
