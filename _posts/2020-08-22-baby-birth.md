Had a few friends over "my house" (which was some hybrid between Ma-Ma's house and some other dreamscape with 2 stories). I was downstairs with them, and it felt like Lauren and Ryan.

When they left, it was night and the house was dark. I went upstairs and was talking to Ma-Ma while she was in different rooms. I never saw her, she was always in a different room. When she was in the bathroom, I asked "Do you know Ryan?" and she replied that she didn't.

Time changed, it was day. I was walking or maybe rollerskating around outside under a perfectly blue sky. The location felt like a college campus. Lots of concrete. I was either texting or talking with Lydia on the phone, she was at the hospital giving birth. I was lying in bed texting Lydia. She said she just gave birth and was home now. I didn't rush out of bed. Some amount of time passed and I went upstairs--I was back downstairs I suppose--to see her. She was lying in a bed that looked like my mom's room in Ma-Ma's house.

We basically had small talk. She said "I feel fat" and I asked "Do you have lots of extra skin?" There was no baby anywhere, but she did pull down the sheets and quickly showed a bloody lower-stomach area. I asked if she got a c-section, but she said that she didn't.

I realized that I needed to wake up and write about this in my dream journal. I started to create the document on the computer and was thinking about the header and changing the date to be accurate, thinking it was the same date as the last entry.

I woke up.
