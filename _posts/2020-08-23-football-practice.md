I was at a school football field and sports complex, it was a warm night. Big lights lit the entire area. There were a lot of people around, and most of them were Science Center employees.

I was shuffling around the field, just talking to people. We were deciding what to do for dinner and plans after leaving the stadium. There were about a dozen people on a smaller field still doing some type of physical practice or activity, we were all waiting on them to finish before we could leave.

Walking over to the smaller field, I notice Matt K's brother not participating in the activity. Halfway joking, I was yelling to him to get on the field. His partner was Caitlin M, she was also yelling something from the other side. Part of me wanted him to finish the activity so we could leave, and the other part of me wanted to take his spot... so I ran onto the field toward Caitlin.

She explained the game to me, we had to run 5 times across the field. I thought that sounded fine and I was ready to do a really good job and impress everyone. She then showed me a dance move that had to be done, it wasn't just running. Basically, step 1 was hands out palms up and feet separated, step 2 was arms crossed in front and feet crossed. Like a dance from the movie Grease.

I told her how silly that was and "I can't do that!" but she said I had to. She counted down and I awkwardly started, but she didn't do the dance. She just jogged along. I was upset, but it was kind of funny, and said "Why aren't you doing this?!" and she said it was only for me to do. "That's the rule."

I "danced" multiple times across the small field and we completed the task. Caitlin had in her hands what looked like a cat tin and forced a piece of chocolate brownie in my mouth. She asked something like, "Do you like the flavor of (    )". She had a look on her face and said "We're going partying, get ready!" I asked what she just fed me, and she said I would feel it soon.

Immediately, I got nervous. I asked her "How much weed is in this?" and she replied 300 grams. I tried to laugh to sound cool with it. She then said, "Actually it's like 50 grams" and I felt better, just because it was a smaller number. "Oh, that makes me feel much better" I replied. She came back with, "I meant, 500 grams".

I started to feel woozy, and said I needed to go home. Caitlin was saying we all need to go out and party. I was making up excuses, and said I was tired. I was looking around for Lydia, I was ready to go. I noticed JoAnn on the big field across the complex, doing some type of game. Lydia was sitting on a bench watching the big field.

The bench was in front of a store, a mixture of a campus book store and a beach novelty shop. I made my way over to her.

I woke up.
